configure file will contain the information about the connectinon which are always reqired for doing stuffs like DataBase connectinon and other things 

in this Folder we will create a file called database.js and in this file we will do the things like::>
1. import mongoose
2. create function DBConnection()=which will connect the file
       ==>const DBconnect=()=>{
            mongoose.connect(process.env.DATABASE_URL,
            {useNewUrlParser:true,
            useUnifiedTopology:true,})
    } here process is an object to use this we have to install .env from npm
       ==>npm i .env
       ==>require("dotenv").config(); after installing .env we write this code above function and this means that the data present in the .env file will automatically come inside the process object
